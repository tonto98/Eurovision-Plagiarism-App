Waking up in the morning and I'm
I'm feeling like ooh-la-la 
It’s about to go down cause I found out the truth, la-la
9 o clock in the morning and I know this is our last night
I know what I’m doing cause
Yeah I got it on black and white

Should’ve known that you are a liar
But I looked the other way
Should’ve known you’re a trouble maker
But you act too nice to hate

I knew we couldn’t get much higher
But you promised the world to me
Do you see that you light my fire
Now I know what I know

Because of you
I'll make it through

Take a look at yourself 
Cause that is what you need to do, to do
Cause the only problem in this room
Is about you, about you
Cause you're a liar

Liar, Liar, Liar
You lie

Waking up in the morning and I'm
I'm feeling like ooh-la-la 
Now I know that your heart and your mind don’t align, la-la
I can see it in your eyes that you don't like to be this way
I know that you're fighting back
Guys like you can't be changed

Should’ve known that you are a liar
But I looked the other way
Should’ve known you’re a trouble maker
But you act too nice to hate

I knew we couldn’t get much higher
But you promised the world to me
Do you see that you light my fire
Now I know what I know

Because of you
I'll make it through

Take a look at yourself 
Cause that is what you need to do, to do
Cause the only problem in this room 
Is about you, about you
Cause you're a liar

Because of you
I'll make it through

Take a look at yourself 
Cause that is what you need to do, to do
Cause the only problem in this room 
Is about you, about you
Cause you're a liar
