Don’t you know
That you got me
That you got me
Yeah me-e-e
Yeah

Got me so hot, burning up like a fever
I’m a honeypot, never tasted nothing sweeter
Thought you could turn me down, no no no
Let’s go another round, slow-oh-oh

Don’t you tell me I’m your addiction
It was obvious you’d end up like this

Oh my god you got-got-got me on (loo-oh-oh-oop)
Cause I’m in but the bla-bla-blame is on (you-oh-oh-oh)
Let me tease you boy, you love it when I m-m-m-move, got you on loop
In your head all night you
Got me on
Got me on
Got me on
(loo-oh-oh-oop)

Cherry on top you’re the cinnamon, making my heart skip a little bit
Like ra-pa-pa-bam-ba, ra-pa-pa-bam-ba, yeah
You know how to spin me boy
Don’t you know you’re my, my addiction
It was obvious we’d end up like this

Oh my god you got-got-got me on (loo-oh-oh-oop)
Cause I’m in but the bla-bla-blame is on (you-oh-oh-oh)
Let me tease you boy, you love it when I m-m-m-move, got you on loop
In your head all night you
Got me on
Got me on
Got me on
(loo-oh-oh-oop)

It was obvious, we’re addicted, addicted
Yeah, it was obvious
Here we go again
Huh

Oh my god you got-got-got me on (loo-oh-oh-oop)
Cause I’m in but the bla-bla-blame is on (you-oh-oh-oh)
Let me tease you boy, you love it when I m-m-m-move, got you on loop
In your head all night you
Got me on
Got me on
Got me on
(loo-oh-oh-oop)
