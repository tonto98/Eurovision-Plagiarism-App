My heart is broken
But it's kind of ironic
Nothing romantic
A wound between the two
I know it sounds tragic
But not
Can you stop wasting time
Looking for my veins?
I know there is nothing to do
But who are you?
Please take it out

You will be able to jump
All night
Come and give me a reason
To want to change
Those voices
You know that some people lie
And others don't

M.E.L.A.P.E.L.A.
That if you don't love me
Other people will love me

Do you want to be a big bad wolf?
And you are the pathetic lesser evil
You think you can bring me down
We lit Benidorm
You say it's illogical
Even magical
And it's just rock and roll

You will be able to jump
All night
Come and give me a reason
To want to change
Those voices
You know that some people lie
And others don't
Give me a sign
I always want more
I won't take a step back
If I am where you are

We like to party
But we love rock

You will be able to jump
All night
Come and give me a reason
To want to change
Those voices
You know that some people lie
You will be able to jump
All night
Come and give me a reason
To want to change
Those voices
You know that some people lie
And others don't

M.E.L.A.P.E.L.A.
That if you don't love me
Other people will love me
