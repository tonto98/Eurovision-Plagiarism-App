I know I’m just a vixen to you,
My past is gobbling you up,
I know I’m the black sheep,
The misunderstood, the one made of stone.

I know I’m not who you want me to be 
(I know)
I get it, it’s driving you up the wall 
(I know)
But this is just my nature,
Can’t be bothered changing for you.

I’m in a good place now,
It was just a matter of time,
I’m gonna hit the streets and shout out what I feel,
From the rooftops.

If I head out solo, I’m a bit of a vixen,
If I’m having fun, I’m the biggest vixen,
If I stretch the night till it’s daylight,
I’m an even bigger vixen.

When I get what I want 
(Zorra, Zorra)
It’s never ‘cause I deserve it 
(Zorra, Zorra)
Even though I’m taking on the world,
No one appreciates it at all.

I’m in a good place now,
It was just a matter of time,
I’m gonna hit the streets and shout out what I feel,
From the rooftops.

I’m in a good place now 
(Zorra, Zorra)
Rebuilt from the inside out 
(Zorra, Zorra)
And that vixen you were so scared of,
She’s been empowering herself,
And now she’s a picture-perfect vixen 
(Zorra, Zorra, Zorra)

Who’s not doing so badly 
(Zorra, Zorra, Zorra)
And couldn’t care less about anything
Go ahead, throw stones, if that’s your thing,
I’m a picture-perfect vixen,

I’m a real woman 
(Zorra, Zorra, Zorra)
And if I get all worked up 
(Zorra, Zorra, Zorra)
From vixen, I might just turn into a jackal,
If so, you’re in trouble,
I’m a picture-perfect vixen 
(Zorra, Zorra, Zorra).

I’m in a good place now,
Just a matter of time,
I’m gonna hit the streets and shout out what I feel,
From the rooftops.

I’m in a good place now 
(Zorra, Zorra, Zorra)
Rebuilt from the inside out 
(Zorra, Zorra, Zorra)
And that vixen you were so scared of,
She’s been empowering herself,
And now she’s a picture-perfect vixen
