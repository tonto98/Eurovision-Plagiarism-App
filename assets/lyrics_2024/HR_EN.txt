Ay, I’m a big boy now
I’m ready to leave, ciao mamma ciao
Ay, I’m a big boy now
I’m going away and I sold my cow

But before I leave, I must confess
I need a round of decompress
One more time for all the good times

Gonna miss you all, but mostly the cat
Gonna miss my hay, gonna miss my bed
Most of all I’m gonna miss the dance
So come on ya’ll, let us prance

Rim Tim Tagi Digi

Don’t call, don’t write
I’m leaving with the first light
Don’t cry, but dance
Rim Tim Tagi Digi Rim Tim Tim

There’s no going back
My presence fades to black
There’s no going back
My anxiety attacks
Rim Tim Tagi Digi Rim Tim Tim

Rim Tim Tagi Digi
Rim Tim Tagi Digi
Rim Tim Tagi Digi
Rim Tim Tagi Digi

I hope I find, peace in the noise
Wanna become one of the city boys
They’re all so pretty and so advanced
Maybe they also know our dance

Bye mom, bye dad
Meow cat, please meow back
Don’t cry, just dance
Rim Tim Tagi Digi Rim Tim Tim

There’s no going back
My presence fades to black
There’s no going back
My anxiety attacks
Rim Tim Tagi Digi Rim Tim Tim

There’s no going back
My presence fades to black
There’s no going back
My anxiety attacks
Rim Tim Tagi Digi Rim Tim Tim

There’s no going back
My presence fades to black
There’s no going back
My anxiety attacks
