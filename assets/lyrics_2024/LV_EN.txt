Don’t look now
You’ll see me crying rivers I might drown
Don’t know how
Oh will I ever find my own way out

I don’t wanna lose me so cruelly
I’m drifting in and out of who I am
So help me understand

It’s killing me slow
Try to make me just another believer
Everybody just pretending they're preachers, preachers
It's killing me slow
Yeah I'd rather let them dig my grave shallow
Instead of selling out to something so hollow, hollow

Not afraid
Oh to tell you all my sins I can’t escape
No I won’t change
Woah it's like a bad disease that I can’t shake

I don’t wanna lose me so cruelly
I’m drifting in and out of who I am
So help me understand

It’s killing me slow
They try to make me just another believer
Everybody just pretending they're preachers, preachers
It's killing me slow
Yeah I'd rather let them dig my grave shallow
Instead of selling out to something so hollow
