I hid in the river.
And went into the silent night.

With loud steps.
Voiceless cries for help.

Now that I am just water.
In the waves, I seek peace.

I drown in myself.
I surrender to the light.

Find me, wound me, protect me.
(Who do you chase when you leave me?)
Lift me up, let me go, love me.
(Who hunts you when you fear me?)

Who are you afraid of,
when you deny your desires?

You look me in the eyes.
The image of you shines in them.

I am a frameless mirror.
Just a reflection of your fears.

Find me, wound me, protect me.
(Who do you chase when you leave me?)
Lift me up, let me go, love me.
(Who hunts you when you fear me?)

I am.
You are.
Veronika.

Only she knows your truth.
