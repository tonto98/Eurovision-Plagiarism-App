They tell me: 
“Jako, be humble!”
“Don't talk too much!”
“Don't stay too quiet!”
“Wear this, open this, close that,”
“Behave like a girl!’
But I am a free girl, so I will dance and you will watch!

La La La 

Come, come, come and join me!
No matter what they say,
We will forget about the time again,
Come on, come on, come on my dear, get up and dance!

La La La
