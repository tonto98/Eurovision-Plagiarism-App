How many drawings have I done
I’m sittin’ here lookin’ at them
None come to life
This page is lazy
I'm in a rush
And they told me that life is precious
I wear it tall and head high
My necklace has no pearls of wisdom
They gave me colourful beads
For the messed up girls with traumas
To be slowly unravelled growing up
Nevertheless I’m looking great with zero drama
Maybe I’ll move cities once again
Cause staying still
It comes to me, it comes to me

The Boredom
The Boredom
The Boredom
The Boredom

I die without dying
During these wasted days
I live without suffering
There is no greater cross
All we can do is have a laugh during these scorched nights
A crown of thorns will be the dress code for my party

It's the cumbia of boredom
It's the cumbia of boredom
Total
Ah, it's the cumbia of boredom
The cumbia of boredom

How many people see evil in things
It makes me want to run away as they start talking
And I would like to say that I'm fine but then they look at me and scorn
So I say it's difficult to make a living
Business you talk about business
Meanwhile I close my eyes to sign contracts
Princess he calls you princess
So now stop washing the dishes

I die without dying
During these wasted days
I live without suffering
There is no greater cross
All we can do is have a laugh during these scorched nights
A crown of thorns will be the dress code for my party

It's the cumbia of boredom
It's the cumbia of boredom

So do you write songs?
Yes, love songs
And I don't want to bore you
But someone has to sing them
Cumbia, I dance cumbia
If I risk tripping at least I'll stop the boredom
So I'm having a party, I'm having a party
Because it's the only way to stop
To stop
To stop, ah

The Boredom
The Boredom
The Boredom
The Boredom

I die without dying
During these wasted days
I live without suffering
There is no greater cross
All we can do is have a laugh during these scorched nights
A crown of thorns will be the dress code for my party

It's the cumbia of boredom
