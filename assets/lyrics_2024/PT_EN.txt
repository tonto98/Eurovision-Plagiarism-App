I heard it, I felt my body carrying me
We keep going
One and the other, one and the other, one and the other
I'm free falling, I'll let you know when I get there
I surrender myself, little by little

Long strides, stuck in the starting line
I want to let go of what hurt me
I ask the morning star to make the day rise again

(It still burns) I've transformed every verse within me 
(It still burns) And given in to the courage that still burns, still burns
Beats the light in my chest and opens
I'm a flame that still burns, still burns, still burns

Today I want to prove to myself
That I can be whatever I want (whatever I want)
Gather those who love me around a table
Forgive those who wanted to see me suffer
I can't be fooled (no, no)
I am whole (I am)
I still remember when I was little
I dreamed first

Long strides, stuck in the starting line
I want to let go of what hurt me
I ask the morning star to make the day rise again

(It still burns) I've transformed every verse within me 
(It still burns) And given in to the courage that still burns, still burns
Beats the light in my chest and opens
I'm a flame that still burns, still burns, still burns

I'm a flame that still burns, still burns
I'm a flame that still burns, still burns
It burns, it burns, it burns

I've transformed every verse within me
And given in to the courage that still burns, still burns
Beats the light in my chest and opens
I'm a flame that still burns, still burns, still burns
