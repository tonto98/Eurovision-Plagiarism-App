Welcome to the show
Let everybody know
I’m done playing the game
I’ll break out of the chains

You better buckle up
I’ll pour another cup
This is my boheme
So drink it up my friend

Uhhh Uhhh
This story is my truth

I, I went to hell and back
To find myself on track
I broke the code
Oh, Oh, Oh
Like ammonites
I just gave it some time
Now I found paradise
I broke the code
Oh, Oh, Oh

Let me tell you a tale about life
‘Bout the good and the bad, better hold on tight
Who decides what’s wrong, what’s right
Everything is balance, everything’s light
I got so much on my mind
And I been awake all night
I’m so pumped, I’m so psyched
It’s bigger than me, I’m getting so hyped

Uhhhh
Let me taste the lows and highs
Uhhhh
Let me feel that burning fright

This story is my truth

I, I went to hell and back
To find myself on track
I broke the code
Oh, Oh, Oh
Like ammonites
I just gave it some time

Oh, Oh, Oh

Somewhere between the 0s and 1s
That’s where I found my kingdom come
My heart beats like a…
Somewhere between the 0s and 1s

My heart beats like a drum

I, I went to hell and back
To find myself on track
I broke the code
Oh, Oh, Oh
Like ammonites
I just gave it some time
Now I found paradise
I broke the code
Oh, Oh, Oh
