May pain not come to us

I fall and move like dice

I pretend to forget your name

And everything changes around me abruptly

Where will the wind take us?

I fall and roll like dice

I pretend to forget your scent

And everything is changing around me

I’m gonna do it my way

I’ll come in and out of your mind

You never gave me a hand to hold

I used to want you secretly

Now I’m letting it all go

Let’s go

Put your hands up

Pretend it wasn’t a lie

Fall one last time

And let whatever happens happen

(ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ)

(ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ)

And let whatever happens happen

ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ

And let whatever happens happen

(ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ)

And let whatever happens happen

(ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ)

And let whatever happens happen

I don’t want to remember

The hours where I almost went crazy

Let me not remember

You didn’t believe that karma was real

Let’s go

Put your hands up

Pretend it wasn’t a lie

Roll it one last time

And let whatever happens happen

(ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ)

Even if I stay alone

I will always be waiting for you

I’m trembling like a flame

Like a lighted up match

When the dawn comes

I pine away

I die alone if you are not here

(ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ)

And let whatever happens happen

(ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ)

Let whatever happens happen

(ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ)

And let whatever happens happen

(ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ)

Let whatever happens happen

May pain not come to us

I fall and move like dice

I pretend to forget your name

And everything changes around me abruptly

Where will the wind take us?

I fall and roll like dice

I pretend to forget your scent

And everything is changing around me abruptly

(ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ)

And let whatever happens happen

(ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ ΤΑ)

Let whatever happens happen

And let whatever happens happen

(ΤΑ ΤΑ)

And everything is changing around me abruptly
