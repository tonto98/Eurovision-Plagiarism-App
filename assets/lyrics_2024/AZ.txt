I lived a life standing on my own,
Chaos inside and mysteries unsolved.

Only with you I feel
How the burdens of my life just disappear.
Through all the lows and highs
Love has guided me to gates of paradise.

Hold my heart in your hands,
Do you have what it takes?

Hurricanes are roaming but you take away the pain
Healing all the scars and breaking chains.

Gəl özünlə apar,
Sənsiz göy mənə dar
