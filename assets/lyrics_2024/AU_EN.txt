I stand in the eye of the spiral
One of them billion-iIlions, billion-iIlions
My soul slips away from its title
One of them billion-iIlions
And I descend to the centre of the earth

I may be dreaming,
But the atoms are awake,
Spill the tea on reality,
And the 0.618

What ya gonna do in the real world Mickey?
What ya gonna do when you see?
Blood, one blood, blood

Escape with us to the planets
To the Fleetwood Macs and the Janets
Blood la

While entertaining the Gods
One blood la, blood la
It’s raining love
One blood la, blood la

We’re on a gravitron
As it tangles
With them billion-iIlions
Of our souls and angels
We kiss and matter dismantles

To see we don’t own the universe
Feel the borders blur
We belong to her

I may be dreaming,
But the atoms are awake,
Spill the tea on reality,
And the 0.618

What ya gonna do in the real world Mickey?
What ya gonna do when you see?
Blood, one blood, blood

Escape with us to the planets
To the Fleetwood Macs and the Janets
Blood la

While entertaining the Gods
One blood la, blood la
It’s raining love
One blood la, blood la

While entertaining the Gods
One blood la, blood la
It’s raining love
One blood la, blood la

Blood, one blood
Blood, one blood
Blood la one blood la
It’s raining love
Blood la, one blood la, blood la
One blood la
