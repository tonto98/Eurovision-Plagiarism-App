We stand eye to eye
You try and set a fire
Just to watch me burn
It's like you don't know

That I will survive
Learned how to stay alive
Come and throw your flames
Cause it's all in vain

Even if I fall, I'm gon' get up
I'll be standing tall, proud, with my head up
Go 'head and give your best shot

I won't go down
I'll never break
Like a titan I'll be brave
Tonight 
I'll rise
I won't give up
Fight till the end
Every tear's gonna ricochet
I rise
Rise
I’m a titan in disguise

I bet you thought that I would crumble, but i won't
You thought I wouldn't make it out here on my own
You thought you'd see me broken, I'm going strong
Still going strong
Got an armour round my heart, it's unbreakable
Got my feet on the ground, I'm unshakable
And If you think I won't survive, then you're so wrong
You’re so wrong

I won't go down
I'll never break
Like a titan I'll be brave
Tonight
I'll rise
I won't give up
Fight till the end
Every tear's gonna ricochet
I rise
Rise
I’m a titan in disguise

I won't go down
I'll never break
Like a titan I'll be brave
Tonight
I'll rise
I won't give up
Fight till the end
Every tear's gonna ricochet
I rise
Rise
I’m a titan in disguise
