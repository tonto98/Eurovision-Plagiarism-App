You're not 20 anymore
You don't have time
To act like a child
To just party
You don't have money
No momentum
You're really
Heading towards defeat
And I hear in the distance, in the distance, in the distance
This little voice, siren's song
That tells me to come
Go ahead, take my hand
Come on, I'll take you

That tells me softly

Come
I will never let you down
I know you're a fighter
Hold
In your heart the love around
You know you're a fighter
And I hear in the distance, in the distance, in the distance
This little voice that repeats to me
Where are you going?

I admit I don't know
I want everything and nothing at once
I'll end up completely crazy
And there you go

You don't have the right
To stay like this
You have to make choices
What's on your mind?
Fight battles
Believe in yourself
The world is there
Go conquer it
And I hear in the distance, in the distance, in the distance
This little voice, siren's song
That tells me to come
Go towards your destiny
You must not slow down

That tells me softly

Come
I will never let you down
I know you're a fighter
Hold
In your heart the love around
You know you're a fighter
And I hear in the distance, in the distance, in the distance
This little voice that repeats to me
Where are you going?

I admit I don't know
I want everything and nothing at once
I'll end up completely crazy
And there you go
I admit I don't know
I want everything and nothing at once
I'll end up completely crazy
And there you go

Hear the sound of your dreams
You are so near
They are so near, look around
Hear the sound of your dreams
Not of your fears
And just open up your heart

Come
I will never let you down
I know you're a fighter
Hold
In your heart the love around
You know you're a fighter
And this voice
It goes away
It comes back
In my head
Where are you going?

I admit I don't know
I want everything and nothing at once
I'll end up completely crazy
And there you go
I admit I don't know
I want everything and nothing at once
I'll end up completely crazy
And there you go

And there you go
