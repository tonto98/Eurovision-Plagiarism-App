One day has passed and then another
As if, the time has stopped.
I’m going somewhere, then some place else,

And after it gets dark, it will all repeat again.

Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
I promise to love you tomorrow
In the night, in the night, in the night
You will find me in the night.

Am I still alive?
Do you still recognise me?
The sun isn't coming up.
Tell me, will you stay by my side?
Wait up, wait up
Just another minute
Wait up, wait up
Just another minute

One night has passed, and then another
But as always, I start over again.

We’re standing in silence while the radio’s playing
I don't want to dance anymore.
We’re standing in silence while the radio’s playing
I don't want to dance, but I have to dance.
