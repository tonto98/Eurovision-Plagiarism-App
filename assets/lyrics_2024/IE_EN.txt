Avada Kadavra
I speak to destroy
The feelings I have I cannot avoid
Through twisted tongues
A hex deployed on you

That all the pretties in your bed
Escape your hands and make you sad
And all the things you wish you had you lose

I, I, I know you’re living a lie
I, I, I see the scars in your eyes
I, I, I know you’re living a lie

I, I, I guess you’d rather have a star than the moon
I guess I always overestimate you
Hoodoo all the things that you do
I’m down down in my Doomsday blue

(I, I, I know you’re living a lie)
(I, I, I know you’re living a lie)

Avada Kadavra
The thoughts in my head
The places I touch when lying in bed
The visions of you the words that you said
Undo

My heartbeat buried in the ground
And to the strings I bind you’re bound
So when you sleep you’ll hear my sound
(cuckoo)

I, I, I know you’re living a lie
I, I, I see the scars in your eyes
I, I, I know you’re living a lie

I, I, I guess you’d rather have a star than the moon
I guess I always overestimate you
Hoodoo all the things that you do
I’m down down in my Doomsday blue

I guess you’d rather have a star than the moon
I guess I always overestimate you
Hoodoo all the things that you do
I’m down down in my Doomsday blue

For your romance
I’d beg steal and borrow
It’s draining me hollow
You-ooooh

You could slow dance me
Out of my sorrow
But your favourite colour
Compared to the others is doom

Doomsday blue

Blue
Blue
Blue
Blue
Blue
Blue

Avada Kadavra
I speak to destroy!
