Europe let’s come together!
It’s now or never!
I love you all!

Welcome to Europe
Stay here until I die
Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa

Welcome to Europe
Stay here until I die
Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa

Visit my friends in France
Or take a long walk to Vienna
I want to leave the Netherlands
But my passport is gone

Fortunately don't need a visa
To be with you
So take the bus to Poland
Or the train to Berlin

I have no money for Paris
So use my imagination
Do you have a euro please
Say "merci" and "please"

I lost everything
Except time
So am travelling every day
For the world is mine

Welcome to Europe
Stay here until I die
Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa

Welcome to Europe
Stay here until I die
Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa

Euro-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Euro-pa-pa-pa
Euro-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Eu-ro-pa!

Ich bin in Deutschland
Aber Ich bin so allein
Io sono in Italia
but still I feel pain

Am running from myself
Calling for "help!" all day long
Yes I even give people money
But there is no one to help me

I don't need es-car-gots
Don't need fish 'n chips
Don't need paella, no
I don't even really know what that is

Turn on the radio
I hear Stromae with "Papaoutai"
Won't stop until they say
"Yes, yes, he does that very well ey!"

Welcome to Europe
Stay here until I die
Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa

Welcome to Europe
Stay here until I die
Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa

Euro-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Euro-pa-pa-pa
Euro-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Eu-ro-pa!
Euro-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa….

Welcome in Europe boy!

At the end of the day
we are all human beings.
My father told me once that
the world has no borders.

I miss you every day
is what I whisper to myself.
You see, dad,
I did listen to you.
