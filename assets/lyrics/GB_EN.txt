There’s a place where
We break the line
Make it a circle redefined
Beautiful gardens
Eternal flowers
You know the way so take me there

Won’t you make me
Dizzy from your kisses
Will you take my hand and spin me
Round and round until the moment never ends
Make me dizzy from your kisses
Will you take my hand and spin me
Take me back to the beginning again (again, again)

Pulling me close
I feel a stillness in the air
Time has frozen
All memories lost

So won’t you make me
Dizzy from your kisses
Will you take my hand and spin me
Round and round until the moment never ends
Make me dizzy from your kisses
Will you take my hand and spin me
Take me back to the beginning again (again, again)

So won’t you make me…
There isn’t an end
There isn’t a start
I don’t wanna stop
I can’t go too far
There isn’t an end
There isn’t a start
I don’t wanna stop
I can’t go too far
There isn’t an end
There isn’t a start
I don’t wanna stop
I can’t go too far
There isn’t an end
There isn’t…

So won’t you make me
Dizzy from your kisses
Will you take my hand and spin me
Round and round until the moment never ends
Make me dizzy from your kisses
Will you take my hand and spin me
Take me back to the beginning again (again, again)
