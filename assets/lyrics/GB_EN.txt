When you said you were leavin'
To work on your mental health
You didn't mention the cheating
You kept that one to yourself.

I got so mad was gonna
Cuss you out, outside your house
For everyone to see.
Wanted to trash your Benz
Tell all your friends
How cruel you were to me.

Instead I wrote a song
Bout how you did me wrong
I could have cried at home
And spent the night alone.

Instead I wrote a song
I feel much better now
Me and my girls are out
And we all sing along.

Instead I wrote a song.

Instead I wrote a song.

I kept my cool and composure
My mother would be so proud
I was ready for a sentence baby
Instead I wrote it all down.

Oh I was gonna
Cuss you out, outside your house
For everyone to see.
Wanted to trash your Benz
Tell all your friends
How cruel you were to me.

Instead I wrote a song
Bout how you did me wrong
I could have cried at home
And spent the night alone.
Instead I wrote a song
I feel much better now
Me and my girls are out
And we all sing along.

Instead I wrote a song.

Instead I wrote a song.

Let's celebrate
Dance it away
I thought my heart would break...

Instead I wrote a song
Bout how you did me wrong
I could have cried at home
And spent the night alone.
Instead I wrote a song
I feel much better now
Me and my girls are out
And we all sing along.

Instead I wrote a song.
