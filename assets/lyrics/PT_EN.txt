I'm counting down the days
With my suitcase packed
All my built-up saudade could hardly fit

I can see the garden from the blue
Just behind the wing
Mom, look out the window, I'm coming home

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home

No matter how it may seem
I'll never belong to that city
The sea of people, the different sun
The concrete hills don’t stir anything in me
They don’t feel like home
Because I

I came from far away
I came from the middle of the sea, in the heart
Of the ocean I have my whole life
I make my way thinking of returning
To my home, island, peace, Madeira

If I explain it to you word by word
You'll never understand the pain that silences me
The loneliness that haunts the moment of departure

I take solace in being able to return
Mom, look out the window, I'm coming

No matter how it may seem
I'll never belong to that city
The sea of people, the different sun
The concrete hills don’t stir anything in me
They don’t feel like hoooooome

The sea of people, the different sun
The concrete hills don’t stir anything in me
They don’t feel like home
