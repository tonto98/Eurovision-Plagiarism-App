I don't find any joy anymore
From the same old cycle
Don’t know what made me happy before
From all to zero
Where did I go

Between falling and running I’ve been trying to get on my feet in time
I’ve never been good at crying always wanted to be the tough type

I’m sorry I’m
Just human I’m
Losing myself
While chasing highs
Losing myself
While chasing highs
And burning daylight

I don't believe in God anymore
Cos where did she go
I don't know what I’ve been looking for
I guess a hero

Between falling and running I’ve been trying to get on my feet in time
I’ve never been good at crying always wanted to be the tough type

I’m sorry I’m
Just human I’m
Losing myself
While chasing highs
And burning daylight
I’m scared that I’m
Falling behind
I'm losing myself
While chasing highs
I’m losing myself
While chasing highs
And burning daylight

Goodbye old life
Goodbye old life
Goodbye old life
Goodbye old life
Goodbye old life
Goodbye old life
