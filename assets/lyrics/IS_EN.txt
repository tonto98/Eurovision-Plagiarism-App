I feel it coming
I feel it coming

Look how far we made it
Standing on the edge of a promise
I’m not one to take risks
Getting hurt taught me to be cautious

Maybe we should leave this
Cause what would be the use
Of crashing into you
We could end up in pieces
Don't need another heart-shaped bruise

I feel it coming
Been here before and never got it right
Baby I'm wondering
If falling in love has got me scared of heights
I know we’re going sky high
Going sky high
But what if we forget how to fly
Baby I'm wondering
If falling in love has got me scared of heights

Dive in with my heart first
I'm still drowning in this rational fear
Wish that I could unlearn
I can't enjoy the view from up here

Maybe we should leave this
Cause what would be the use
Of crashing into you
We could end up in pieces
Don't need another heart-shaped bruise

I feel it coming
Been here before and never got it right
Baby I'm wondering
If falling in love has got me scared of heights
I know we’re going sky high
Going sky high
But what if we forget how to fly
Baby I'm wondering
If falling in love has got me scared of heights

I feel it coming
I feel it coming

I feel it coming
Been here before and never got it right
Baby I'm wondering
If falling in love has got me scared of heights

Oh I'm scared of heights
Fell a couple times
And I barely made it out alive
Oh I'm scared of heights
But the truth is I'm
Still falling if I kiss you goodbye
So baby I'm wondering
If falling in love has got me scared of heights
