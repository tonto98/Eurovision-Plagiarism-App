Rowing today, rowing tonight
Rowing to where the stars are bright
And nothing's ever stopping me now

Rowing today, rowing tonight
Rowing to where the stars are bright
And nothing's ever stopping me now

I cut up a tree
And made me a boat
And when I get wet
Well I'll still be afloat

For hours and hours
I pull at the oars
I'm heading for heaven
I'll make it of course

I'm strapped in this craft
In my waterproof boots
Through the sleet and the snow
In my silver wetsuit

The tide is high, the sea is pouring in
I'll sail alone to where I've never been
Cos I'm feeling lucky and I'm gonna win
(So) I'll just adjust the rudder and be sailing again

Rowing today, rowing tonight
Rowing to where the stars are bright
And nothing's ever stopping me now

Rowing today, rowing tonight
Rowing to where the stars are bright
And nothing's ever stopping me now

It didn't tip up
I'm still in the boat
Heading for Greenland
And somewhere remote (God damn!)

Steering out at sea, I'm the captain!
Call me GÃ­sli Marteinn.
Week after week under stormy grey sky
Gonna stay on the sea til the day that I die

The tide is high, the sea is pouring in
I'll sail alone to where I've never been
Cos I'm feeling lucky and I'm gonna win
(So) I'll just adjust the rudder and be sailing again

Rowing today, rowing tonight
Rowing to where the stars are bright
And nothing's ever stopping me now
