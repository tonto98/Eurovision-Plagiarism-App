At this minute,
At this moment,
No more paranoia.
After the rain
The world seems like a rainbow.
No ambulances
Roaming the streets,
No one arrogantly speaks.
Forecast for today, true:
The skies still will be blue.

Ending under the water,
My mouth never dried up.
Imagine a minute, try,
Without soldiers,
With no orphans crying.
No bottles in the ocean,
Diesel smelling like lilac.
The freedom of speech
Taught in a school class.

Carve in me a clean heart,
I’ll send the light,
In my darkness, night.
Aman, miserere!
Aman, miserere!

In my heart,
In this heart of mine,
This minute eternally lasts,
Good people blast.

Decent people,
Dance in their soul
Hey, hop my soil!
I’ll never forget the cradle I was born
Oh, hey, my world
Keep shining on me!
Enlighten!
Shine!
Splendidly shine!
Shine on!

Fire!
Fall upon our tribal wild dances,
As avalanche echoes
On mountains, rolls down.

Fire!
The nameless and pure people,
Fall and roll down the same
As seven knives the soul straightly pierce.

Fire!
Here the sea, the sand and the moon sleep,
And the stars we do not see
Trampled under the feet,
Sleepwalking to be free.

Fire!
For flames and light starving,
For you endlessly searching,
In this shining darkness thirsting for brightness.

Carve in me a clean heart
In the darkness, I’ll send you the light
Aman, miserere!
Aman, miserere!

In my pulsating heart,
In my beating heart!

This minute will keep on keeping on,
Decent beings,
Good people,
Dance around in their soul.
Hey, hop my soil!
I’ll never forget the cradle I was born
Oh, hey, my beloved world,
Keep shining on me!
Shine!
Shine on!
