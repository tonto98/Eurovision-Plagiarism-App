Something inside me
Takes my breath away
Don’t know what’s going on
But I want to make it stop
(What’s going on)
Having it all
And having it all,
But isn’t enough
(Why)

They’re falling apart
Just for a word
They’re falling apart
They killed love
They’re falling apart
And they forgot
How we were a home,
A table filled with kids

Love it,
Like you used to love it,
That love, keep it
Just like the life, you love it
Don’t throw stones on it,
But just like you used to, love it,
That love, keep it
Like the life you love, love it

They’re falling apart
Just for a word
They’re falling apart
They killed love
They’re falling apart
And they forgot
How we were a home,
A table filled with kids

Love it,
Like you used to love it,
That love, keep it
Just like the life, you love it
Don’t throw stones on it,
But just like you used to, love it,
That love, keep it
Like the life you love, love it

(Love it, love it)
They’re falling apart
(Love it, love it)
Just for a word
They’re falling apart
They killed love
(Love it, love it)
They’re falling apart
(Love it, love it)
And they forgot
How we were a home,
A table filled with kids
(Love it, love it)
