You said some words
Didn't hear you fall asleep
People were talking louder
From my TV screen

I heard them scream
It was too dark to see

Don't cry
I'll try to
Say the right words at the right times
Sing you lullabies
Please don't wake up wake up

Used to think we live
In a world so beautiful
You see
I think I don't believe
In this stuff anymore

Don't cry
I'll try to
Say the right words at the right times
Sing you lullabies
Please don't wake up wake up

Don't cry
I'll try to
Say the right words at the right times
Sing you lullabies
Please don't wake up wake up

Please don’t make me wake
Don’t make me wake
Please don’t wake up wake up
