Curses and hexes
Never can they ruin me
Never never never
Never can they ruin me

Others are making a bridge of steel
I’m helping an oak to grow
The bridge of steel turns to rust
My oak grows ever green

Curses and hexes
Never can they ruin me
Never never never
Never can they ruin me

Others are making a bridge of steel
I’m helping an oak to grow
The bridge of steel turns to rust
My oak grows ever green

I didn’t know my own happiness
Until I met my misery
