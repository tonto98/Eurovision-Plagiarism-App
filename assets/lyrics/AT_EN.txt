Oh my god, you’re such a good writer
Oh no it’s not me, it’s Edgar 
Who the hell is Edgar?

There’s a ghost in my body
And he is a lyricist
It is Edgar Allan Poe
And I think he can‘t resist
Yeah his brain is in my hand
And it’s moving really fast, mhm

Don’t know how he possessed me
But I’m happy that he did
‘Cause this song is feeling special
And is gonna make me rich
Yeah the words are spilling out
What the heck is this about, mhm

Oh mio padre, there’s a ghost in my body
Ohhhhhhh

Maybe I should call a doctor
Or an exorcist
Maybe someone out there knows where
Shakespeare is
So I can get a taste
What‘s your IPI, where‘s the A&R
Girl call Universal, you’re about to be a star!

Zero dot zero zero three
Give me two years and your dinner will be free
Gas station Champagne is on me
Edgar cannot pay rent for me
Zero dot zero zero
Zero dot zero zero
Zero dot zero zero three
At least it pays to be funny
