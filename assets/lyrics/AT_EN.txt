Ice running through my veins
You just did it again
Go cause I can’t be your friend
I’m cold but this is not the end

So I go go go
Where the broken hearted go
No one knows a thing about my haunted soul
I go oh oh
Wanna dance it off alone
I won't let it show
They will never know

When the darkness hits and we can’t be saved
We rum de dum dum da – We Will Rave
When our hearts are burning we feel no pain
We rum de dum dum da – We Will Rave

I see only silhouettes
I just wanna forget
About everything we said
And the demons in my head

So I go go go
Where the broken hearted go
No one knows a thing about my haunted soul
I go oh oh
Wanna dance it off alone
I won't let it show
They will never know

When the darkness hits and we can’t be saved
We rum de dum dum da – We Will Rave
When our hearts are burning we feel no pain
We rum de dum dum da – We Will Rave
