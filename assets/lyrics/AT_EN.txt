I’m an ocean of love
And you’re scared of water
You don’t want to go under,
So you let me go under.

I reach out my hand,
But you watch me grow distant
Drift out to the sea
And far away in an instant

You left me in the deep end
I’m drowning in my feelings
How do you not see that?

Now that you’re gone
All I have is wasted love
This wasted love
Now that you’re gone
Can’t fill my heart with wasted love
This wasted love

When you let me go,
I barely stayed afloat
I’m floating all alone
Still I’m holding on to hope

Now that you’re gone
All I have is wasted love
This wasted love
Now that you’re gone
Can't fill my heart with wasted love
This wasted love

Wasted love
This wasted love
Wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted
Wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted, love
Wasted love
