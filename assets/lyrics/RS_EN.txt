Baby watch the world on fire
It is all a game to me
I don’t wanna choose my fighter
Who’s taking control of me?

Hello?
I just wanna sleep [I just wanna sleep]

Go to sleep [go to sleep]

I just wanna sleep forever (Go to sleep)
Like it better when I dream
I wanna sleep forever (Go to sleep) [I just wanna sleep forever]
While the world is burning [while the world is burning]
I just wanna close my eyes
And just get it over with
I wanna sleep forever (Go to sleep) [I just wanna sleep forever]
While the world is burning [while the world is burning]

In the night, the endless hours [in the night, the endless hours]
Devils on my shoulder [devils on my shoulder]
I just wanna sleep forever [I just wanna sleep forever]
So I can power over [so I can power over]

Hello?
Game over

Go to sleep [Go to sleep]

(I just wanna sleep) [I just wanna sleep]


I just wanna sleep forever (Go to sleep)
Like it better when I dream
I wanna sleep forever (Go to sleep) [I just wanna sleep forever]
While the world is burning [while the world is burning]
I just wanna close my eyes
And just get it over with
I wanna sleep forever (Go to sleep) [I just wanna sleep forever]
While the world is burning [while the world is burning]

THE CONSCIENCE IS ASLEEP [the conscience is asleep]
WHILE THE WORLD IS BURNING [while the world is burning]
