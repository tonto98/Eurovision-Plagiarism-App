I don’t have, I don’t have, I don’t have
Neither peace, nor sleep.
The night frightens the day.
The lonely ones suffer.

Everything is quiet just like under the water.
I scream, but the sound doesn’t come out.
There is a white flare behind the mountain,
I cannot see the end of it.
This is the road for wounded,
And there is no one to guide me
Towards the bright North Star.

The world is on fire, every flower too.
Where have lilac ramondas disappeared to?

Lilac ramonda
Lilac ramonda
Lilac ramonda
Lilac ramonda
Ramonda
Lilac ramonda
Lilac ramonda
Lilac ramonda

And there is no one to guide me,
‘Cause all the stars fell asleep.
Prayers also don’t help.
Where have lilac ramondas disappeared to?

Lilac ramonda
Lilac ramonda
Lilac ramonda
Lilac ramonda

Lilac ramonda
Lilac ramonda
Lilac ramonda
Lilac ramonda
Lilac ramonda
Lilac ramonda
Lilac ramonda

It rises from ashes,
One lilac ramonda.
