Looking for a miracle
Waiting for a sun to catch me
Gotta find a way back home
Alone, alone, alone

Hoping for a star to fall
Something I can make a wish on
Could it be that I'm the fool
But aren't we all, we all, we all

Broken bodies
Scattered through my history
Lonely hours
Leading to my destiny
I'm the one who built the tower
I'm the one who holds the power
So come on
Rise up, shout it louder
I'm the one who built the tower

Shining in a tiger's eyes
Only I can find my future
Reading in between the lines
I draw my own, my own, my own

Running down the waterfall
Always tried to chase the rainbow
Never found a pot of gold
Below, below, below

Broken bodies
Scattered through my history
Lonely hours
Leading to my destiny
I'm the one who built the tower
I'm the one who holds the power
So come on
Rise up, shout it louder
I'm the one who built the tower

I'm the one who built the
I'm the one who built the
I'm the one who built the tower

I'm the one who built the
I'm the one who built the
I'm the one who built the tower

Broken bodies
Scattered through my history
Lonely hours
Leading to my destiny
I'm the one who built the tower
I'm the one who holds the power
So come on
Rise up, shout it louder
I'm the one who built the tower

I'm the one who built the
I'm the one who built the
I'm the one who built the tower

I'm the one who built the
I'm the one who built the
I'm the one who built the tower

I'm the one who built the tower
I'm the one who holds the power
So come on
Rise up, shout it louder
I'm the one who built the tower
