How much I write, with any skill
With any style, however smooth
She brings me into a movie, I feel like a child
I spin around like a vinyl
'Cause I want to act in her movie

How much I stay, how much I give
How much I want, how much I drink
With any top, any heel
Whatever the others talked
I still didn't care
I would've chosen her out of thousands of women

Cause I count, she hides
I call her, she doesn't answer
A boxing match with dozens of rounds
And just like a ring

She plays me on her fingers
I believe in her
But she lies so beautifully
She turns me upside-down
'Cause she talks dirty
But only when she wants
Lies so easily
Leaves the bed empty

Don't ya
Now don't ya
Now don't ya
Now don't you just wanna sit right next to me
Favorite dress on the floor in your dreams
The scent of mistake just reminds you of me
And now all of your demons keep screaming my name

Take a little sip of venom, now
Say you love me, say you want me now
Fool me all over again, baby
Lost in your eyes

Nights I crave the touch of you
Wondering just what you do
I'm beggin you I'm on my knees
Take your clothes off step on me

Lost in your bedsheets
Tryna get closer
With marks on my neck
And your makeup all over
Photos of us, babe
Remind me still of ya
King without a queen
What's another way to get me sober?

Off and on
Like a radio song
Messing me around
Turning upside down
Dirty talking me
Every day's a game
Lets me sleep alone
She plays me like oh oh oh

I believe in her
But she lies so beautifully
She turns me upside-down
'Cause she talks dirty
But only when she wants
Lies so easily
Leaves the bed empty

On her fingers
I believe in her
But she lies so beautifully
She turns me upside-down
Talks dirty
But only when she wants
Lies so easily
Leаves the bed empty
On her fingerѕ
Uuuuu
Uuuuu
On her fingerѕ
