I just wanna make art,
Read books and just find someone,
Who likes me enough to kiss my face,
I wanna explore with him and visit old bookstores,
And cute little things, like drink smoothies at near cafes.
Oh – oh – oh,
Drink smoothies at near cafes,
Oh – oh – oh.

Oh future lover, I hope it all comes naturally,
I hope our love is quiet outside, but loud inside oh baby,
Oh future lover, this song I wrote for you,
This song I wrote for you my future lover.

I decide to be good, do good, look good,
I decide to be good, do good, look good,
I decide to be good, do good, look good,
I decide to be good, do good, look good.

It's like a daydream, but I got some other, better plans,
I wanna scream and shout,
My heart caught in chains,
Cold heart, cold hands, fire in my veins,
Fire in my veins, heart in chains,
I'm a volcano that is going to explode in a sec’,
I'm so hypnotised by someone that I've never ever met,
Don’t wanna forget, am I dreaming yet?
Poetic dream, I don՚t want it to end oh,
3 minutes of making impossible plans,
7 minutes of unnecessary panic attacks,
Here I go with the coldest hands,
Here I go with still no plans oh, still no plans,
I can't cool off, no I can't relax,
Lord what I'm gonna’ do my pain just attacks,
I still have the coldest hands,
Oh my Lord, my Lord,
My pain, my panic attacks, oh.

I decide to be good, do good, look good,
I decide to be good, do good, look good,
I decide to be good, do good, look good,
I decide to be good, do good, look good.

Ու դու ինձնից հեռու, [you're so far away from me]
Լքված ես հեռու, հեռու ես դու, [left alone, far far away]
Երազումս ես ու դու էինք լուռ, [you and I, silent in my dream]
Մոլորվում էինք հեռու - հեռու հեռվում [we're lost, far far away]
