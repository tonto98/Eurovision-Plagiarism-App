I got my bad shades on,
Jet-black am in ma zone,
I’m sick of the news,
I’m sick of the views,
I’m sick of the lies they’ve told,

Come on and shine the light,
Come on and shine on me,
Guess you can see,
I don’t believe,
Anything they told me

Letting me down,
Lifting me up,
Keeping me slow, but I can’t stop
It’s tearing me apart, I’m alive
Tryna look up, atop of a rock
Climbing these heights, man
I can’t stop at all
I’m standing tall

I’m a survivor,
Stay aliver,
Do or die in my prime,
I’m a fighter,
I’m a survivor,
Won’t be tied up,
Break from the pain
Take your place, I’ll remind ya

I’m a survivor
RA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA
SUR-VI-VOR!
RA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA
SUR-VI-VOR!
RA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA
SUR-VI-VOR!
Break from the pain,
Take your place, I’ll remind ya!

Kicking me, breaking me,
But I won’t stop,
Pushing me, pulling me,
I will get up,
Hitting me, mocking me,
Stabbing me, crushing me,
Tearing me, burning me,
I’ll never stop,

I could have lost my way,
I could have made mistakes,
I bled a lot, more than you thought,
But I didn’t fade away,

Say you’ll break me down,
And bring me to my knees,
You can do it,
Can you prove it?
But you ain't got shiz on me!
(Ha-ha-ha)

I’m a survivor
RA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA
SUR-VI-VOR!
RA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA
SUR-VI-VOR!
RA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA
SUR-VI-VOR!
Break from the pain,
Take your place, I’ll remind ya!

Breathe in breathe out it’s all done,
Never forget who you are,
Breathe in breathe out it’s all done,
Never forget who you are

I’m a survivor (I’m survivor),
Stay aliver (stay aliver),
Do or die in my prime, I’m a fighter,
(I’m a fighter)
I’m a survivor (I’m survivor),
Won’t be tied up (won’t be tied up),
Break from the pain,
Take your place, I’ll remind ya

I’m a survivor
RA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA
SUR-VI-VOR!
RA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA
SUR-VI-VOR!
(I’m a survivor)
RA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA
SUR-VI-VOR!
Break from the pain, take your place
Break from the pain, take your place
Break from the pain, take your place

I’m a survivor
