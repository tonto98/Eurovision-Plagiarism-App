I see it in the air, I see it in the air
I’m running through these ashes like a firefighter

Put out the fire, put out the fire.
Did we build empires just to watch them burn?
My heart’s beating louder, I’m running like tigers.
No fear in my eyes though.
I will save this love.

The ceiling is falling, the windows are burning.
It’s getting harder to breathe.

Can you hear me calling?
I see ashes falling.
I’m down on my knees.
But I will save this love.

I see it in the air, I see it in the air.
I’m rising from these ashes like a phoenix, yeah.
You know I’ll be there.
You know that I’ll be there.
I’m running through these ashes like a firefighter.

Put out the fire, put out the fire.
Put out the fire, put out the fire.
Put out the fire.

Come dance with the thunder,
Cause love makes us stronger.
We’re not here forever.
So can we save this love?

From lovers to fighters,
Oh, why do we do this?
We’re meant to rise higher and higher and higher.

The ceiling is falling, the windows are burning.
It’s getting harder to breathe.

Can you hear me calling?
I see ashes falling, falling, falling.

I see it in the air, I see it in the air.
I'm rising from these ashes like a phoenix, yeah.
You know that I’ll be there.
You know that I’ll be there.
I'll be there, I'll be there.

I see it in the air, I see it in the air.
I'm rising from these ashes like a phoenix, yeah.
You know I’ll be there.
You know that I’ll be there.
We’re running through these ashes like a firefighter.

I see it in the air, I see it in the air.
We're rising from these ashes like a phoenix, yeah.
You know I’ll be there.
You know that I’ll be there.
We're rising from these ashes like a phoenix, yeah.
