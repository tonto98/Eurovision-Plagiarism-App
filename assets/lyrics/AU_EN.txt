Have you ever done anything like this before?
Have you ever done anything like this before?
If you’ve never done anything like this before, then you haven’t been alive

Have you ever shut all the open doors
Have you ever just walked on out on your own
Have you ever just lost your mind when you try to unwind or are you coming right back for more?

I’m here tonight
Promise me you’ll hold me till I die
I’m by your side
Promise me it’s gonna, promise me it’s gonna be alright

Ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh-oh-oh
Promise me it’s gonna be alright.
Ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh-oh-oh
Promise me it’s gonna be alright.

Have you ever been alone too much
Have you ever prayed for human touch
Have you ever just lost a little part of you to find a little something new?

Cross my heart
Till the sky turns red in the sunrise
Since you told me everything's alright.
Ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh-oh-oh
Since you told me everything's alright.
Ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh-oh-oh
Promise me it’s gonna be alright.

I’m here tonight
Promise me you’ll hold me till I die
I’m by your side
Promise me it’s gonna, promise me it's gonna, promise me it’s gonna be alright

Ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh-oh-oh
Ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh-oh-oh

Alright!

Cross my heart
Till the sky turns red in the sunrise
Promise me it’s gonna be alright
Be alright!

Alright!
