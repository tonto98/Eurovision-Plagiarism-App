No more lovers
No sleepless nights
See, after all
I've shaped up my life
Emptiness is felt
And the questions deep
How are you up there?
How much of me can you see?
I’ve changed a lot
I’ve grown so much
I’ve kept from you all that I have become
I’m better now, I know the way
I’m done walking down this memory lane
Guess the time is right, I’m moving on
Now I am the one she calls maman
Maman, maman, maman, maman
I’ve fallen in love that never fades
As time slips away
It shines just the same
When he’s holding my hand
I’m no longer afraid
Reminds me of when...
When you held mine back then
I’m better now, I know the way
I’m done walking down this memory lane
Guess the time is right, I’m moving on
Now I am the one she calls maman
Maman, maman, maman,
Maman, maman, maman
I'm better now, I know the way
I’m done walking down this memory lane
Guess the time is right, I’m moving on
Now I am the one she calls maman
Maman, maman, maman,
Guess the time is right, I’m moving on
Now I am the one she calls maman
