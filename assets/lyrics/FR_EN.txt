My heart, my hand, my eyes, my hips
Nothing’s mine anymore
I kill myself
To give them life
And act like it was nothing
In my hell garden
The plants are watered with the dreams and tears
Even at the top of the highest mountain, you still can’t touch the sky

Obviously
All these promises I hear are passing like the wind
Obviously
It’s always quiet before the storm, don’t you forget

It’s always too good to be true
But never too ugly to be unreal
This girl little that I was will never be the same

I trade my future, to get my past back
But time is treacherous
I look for love
But never find it
Like a lost key

It’s not clear in my head
I want the truth
But I keep avoiding it
Even at the top of

You might be on the top of the world
Still your finger won’t touch the sky

Obviously
All these promises I hear are passing like the wind
Obviously
It’s always quiet before the storm, don’t you forget
It’s always too good to be true
But never too ugly to be unreal
This girl little that I was will never be the same

Because I sing
My life and yours
A little romance
As I stand naked before you
Give me a chance

From you to me
From me to you
Didn’t I succeed
Singing the great France

It’s always too good to be true
But never too ugly to be unreal
This girl little that I was will never be the same
Obviously
