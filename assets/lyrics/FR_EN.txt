My love
Tell me what’s on your mind
If all of this makes sense
Sorry if I disturb you

My love
Do you remember us?
Our first rendez-vous?
It was beautiful, It was insane

I love you
I don’t know why
I play the scene again
But it's always the same ending that keeps repeating
You don’t hear anything
What do we do about my pain?
Do you love me or not?

My love
I’ll do all that I can
Create an ocean in the fire
The impossible if you want me to

Oh my love
Please come back to Paris
Do it for us, I am begging you
I promise, I've learned my lesson

I love you
I don’t know why
I play the scene again
But it’s always the same ending that keeps repeating
You don’t hear anything
What do we do about my pain?
Do you love me or not?

Tell me the place, I’ll wait for you
And if you don’t come, I’ll still wait for you
I know it’s silly, but that’s what I’ll do
Filled with hope, I’ll will wait for you

I love you
I don’t know why
I play the scene again
But it's always the same ending that keeps repeating
You don’t hear anything
What do we do about my pain?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me or not?
