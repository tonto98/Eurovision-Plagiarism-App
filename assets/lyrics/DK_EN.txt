Do you remember
Said it’d be easier if I was dead
Cause whenever
You tryna start something I’m in my head

Pink skies
Red wine
I called you mine

September
Naked by your side

On and off
Couldn’t meet me in the middle
I got lost
Still thinking ’bout September

If we could go back to the start
Bet we’d still be falling apart
I’m not scared to love you
But I’m scared of breaking my heart

If we could go back to the start
Bet we’d still be falling apart
I’m not scared to love you
But I’m scared of breaking my heart

Now I remember
I used to tell you all my deepest fears
When fighting
You used ’em just to force some tears

Pink skies
Just like
When we were fine

In September
Now I’m crying by your side

On and off
Couldn’t meet me in the middle
I got lost
Still thinking ’bout September

If we could go back to the start
Bet we’d still be falling apart
I’m not scared to love you
But I’m scared of breaking my heart

If we could go back to the start
Bet we’d still be falling apart
I’m not scared to love you
But I’m scared of breaking my heart

If we’d go back to the start
You’d still be breaking my heart
If we’d go back to the start
You’d still be breaking my heart

On and off
Couldn’t meet me in the middle
I got lost
Still thinking ’bout September

If we could go back to the start
Bet we’d still be falling apart
I’m not scared to love you
But I’m scared of breaking my heart

If we could go back to the start
Bet we’d still be falling apart
I’m not scared to love you
But I’m scared of breaking my heart

If we’d go back to the start
You’d still be breaking my heart
If we’d go back to the start
You’d still be breaking my heart

If we’d go back to the start
You’d still be breaking my heart
If we’d go back to the start
You’d still be breaking my heart
(You’d still be breakin my)
