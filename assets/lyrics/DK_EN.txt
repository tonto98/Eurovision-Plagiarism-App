You show me more
More than meets the eye
You open all the doors inside my mind

I see colours
I never saw before
A thousand shades of light come to life

Making me question
All that I thought true
All that I’m seeing through you

My vision’s blurry
But I can see clearly
Baby, I’m losing control

You’re my hallu-
Hallucination
Hallu-
Hallucination

I’m paranoid
Slipping from reality
You’re leading me into another fantasy

Making me question
All that I thought true
All that I’m seeing through you

My vision’s blurry
But I can see clearly
Maybe, I’m losing control

You’re my hallu-
Hallucination
Hallu-
Hallucination
A new revelation
Hallu-
Hallucination

Worlds are changing, darkness fading
I follow you to the end and now I’m changing (now I’m changing)

It’s a new sensation, ooh
(Worlds are changin’)
(Darkness fading)
(My Hallucination)
Hallucination

(Worlds are changin’)
(Darkness fading)
(My Hallucination)

You’re my hallu-
Hallucination

Hallu-
Hallucination

Hey yeah-yeah-yeah
Hey yeah-yeah-yeah

Hallucination

You’re my hallu-
Hallucination
Hallu-
Hallucination
