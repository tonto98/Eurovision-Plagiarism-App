Blood and glitter
Sweet and bitter
We’re so happy we could die
What we are is but a choice
A promise to ourselves
We are free to break and change
Never forget? Let it go
This or that? No need to know
Whether above or below
We are all from the same blood

Blood and glitter
Sweet and bitter
We’re so happy we could die
Blood and glitter
Sweet and bitter
We’re so happy we could die
Blood and glitter
Saint and sinner
We do fall before we rise
Now go, go
Let your blood flow, flow
With broken wings we’ll learn to fly
We are blood and glitter

Keep your head up in the clouds
With two feet on the ground
Life’s too fast so make it count
Never forget? Let it go
This or that? No need to know
Whether above or below
We are all from the same blood

Blood and glitter
Sweet and bitter
We’re so happy we could die
Blood and glitter
Saint and sinner
We do fall before we rise
Now go, go
Let your blood flow, flow
With broken wings we’ll learn to fly
We are blood and glitter
Oh, oh
Let your blood flow
Blood and glitter
Oh, oh
Let your blood flow

Blood and glitter
Sweet and bitter
We’re so happy we could die
Blood and glitter
Sweet and bitter
We’re so happy we could die
Blood and glitter
Saint and sinner
We do fall before we rise
Now go, go
Let your blood flow, flow
With broken wings we’ll learn to fly
We are blood and glitter
