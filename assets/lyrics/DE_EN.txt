I am nothing but the average
Even though I‘m special to some
I can’t refuse I‘m going under
No one gives a ... about what’s soon to come
What’s soon to come

I know my blessing with the privilege
Of doing anything I want
But I don’t feel like getting stronger
In my mind it’s just a game that can’t be won
That can’t be won

I‘m always on the run, run, run, run
Close but never done, done, done, done
I can’t break out when I‘m free
Lost in my own identity
I‘m on the run, run, run, run

I‘m always on the
Run na na eh, run na na eh
Run na na eh, run na na eh
Run na na eh, run na na eh
Run na na eh, run na na eh

All I do is keep my head up
But it’s time to keep the pace
Like I‘m haunted by the voices
Deep within oh they‘re just never gonna fade (run na na eh, run na na eh)
Not gonna fade

I‘m always on the run, run, run, run
Close but never done, done, done, done
I can’t break out when I‘m free
Lost in my own identity
I‘m on the run, run, run, run

I‘m always on the
Run na na eh, run na na eh
Run na na eh, run na na eh
Run na na eh, run na na eh
Run na na eh, run na na eh

Run from the silence
Screaming for guidance
Who am I fighting for
Get out of my head
I‘m so sick and tired
Can’t do this anymore

Run from the silence
Screaming for guidance
Who am I fighting for
Get out of my head
I‘m so sick and tired
Can’t do this anymore

Run from the silence
Screaming for guidance
Who am I fighting for
Get out of my head
I‘m so sick and tired
Can’t do this anymore
Run from the silence
Screaming for guidance
