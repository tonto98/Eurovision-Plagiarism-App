I shoot holes into the night
Stars fall and bang on my roof
It still hurts a little when I see you again, but
I'll never come back, no matter what you say

I shoot holes into the night
Stars fall and bang on my roof
It still hurts a little when I see you again, but
I'll never come back, no matter what you say

Chalk silhouettes on the sidewalk
A crime scene between us, like on CSI
You said “I'm sorry baby” for the first time
Should have known then, that was the end of us

You put a dot after the sentence
Like you never knew me
So I change perfumes
And buy myself a new outfit

I get that urge again
I want the end of the world
Hah, I think that's it
I shoot for the stars

I shoot holes into the night
Stars fall and bang on my roof
It still hurts a little when I see you again, but
I'll never come back, no matter what you say

I shoot holes into the night
Stars fall and bang on my roof
It still hurts a little when I see you again, but
I'll never come back, no matter what you say

I see the shards of stars, on my skin like glitter
I've learned what doesn't kill me only makes me prettier
Would you still catch a bullet for me?
Because your weapon is now in my hand

I'll put a dot after the sentence
Like I never knew you
And then I'll change perfumes
And buy myself a new outfit

I get that urge again
I want the end of the world
Hah, I think that's it
I shoot for the stars

I shoot holes into the night
Stars are falling and banging on my roof
It still hurts a little when I see you again, but
I'll never come back, no matter what you say

I shoot holes into the night
Stars fall and bang on my roof
It still hurts a little when I see you again, but
I'll never come back, no matter what you say
