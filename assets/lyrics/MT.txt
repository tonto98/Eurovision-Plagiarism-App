I've got a secret you should know
Come a little close, I'll whisper slow
I've got a secret you should know
(Shhh shhh shhh shhh)

People say "don't be so loud"
Watch the words coming out your mouth
Hands crossed, don't dare stand out
(Follow the crowd, follow the crowd)

Pull up, pull up, make 'em all bow down
Shut up, shut up, I'ma be real loud
Get up, get up, I don't back down
(Follow me now, follow me now)

Only lovers, no enemies
Feel it round me queen energy
In my power a higher me
Here's the secret remedy

Why should we let other people decide
When we could be having the time of our lives
Let down your walls, come and dance to my vibe
I do it all the time
Yeah, I do it all the time
