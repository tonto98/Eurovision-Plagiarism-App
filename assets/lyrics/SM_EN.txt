You have snake eyes
And I get butterflies

You have snake eyes
With your hips, with your sexy look
You paralyse
And I get butterflies
In my ears, in my stomach
All the time

Come on baby
Come and find me
I can smell you like an animal
Bring the party
Aphrodite
And I’ll chase you on the dance floor

You have a biting tongue
And it gets me so unstrung

You have a biting tongue
To tie me up and deviate
My inner thoughts
And it gets highly dangerous
Like a drug in my veins
You are poison

Come on baby
Come and find me
I can smell you like an animal
Bring the party
Aphrodite
And I’ll chase you on the dance floor

Come on baby

She knows the way
The way to turn me on
