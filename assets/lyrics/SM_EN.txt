Mom tonight I’m not coming back
But I'm sure I'll end up in some bed, then I’ll sleep
We’re all good guys, alright
Spaghetti, wine, Our Father
And the Mona Lisa laughs, it’s fine but she’s in Paris
The forbidden kisses in the dark streets
Sad eyes but happy, so many friends of friends

And you sing, I hear you through the shouting
The lights pass through the fingers
It doesn’t matter if you have never heard it

But with this thing it jumps

All of Italy, all of Italy, all of Italy
All Italy, all of Italy, all of Italy,
Let us dance with a glass in our hands
Then tomorrow we’ll regret saying I love you
Who here hears us
All of Italy, all of Italy, all of Italy

The football gets kicked
The fashion makes rags
Starred kitchen of leftovers blessed holy Craxi
And so many coins, but the desires are of others
With the gold necklaces on the tank tops
The blue car with flashing lights
Forward people, forward

And you sing, I hear you through the shouting
The lights pass through the fingers
It doesn’t matter if you have never heard it

But with this thing it jumps

All of Italy, all of Italy, all of Italy
All Italy, all of Italy, all of Italy,
Let us dance with a glass in our hands
Then tomorrow we’ll regret saying I love you
Who here hears us
All of Italy, all of Italy, all of Italy
