I wanted to be a tough guy
Who doesn’t care about the future
A robot
A sumo wrestler
A dealer on the run from a wolf dog
At the Bologna station
A hen that lays golden eggs

But I'm nobody
I wasn't born with a tough guy's face
I'm even afraid of the dark
If I get into a fight, I get beaten up
So they paint my eyes black
But I’ve never wasted time
It's time that has left me behind

“Living life is child's play”
That’s what my mom used to tell me
As I fell from trees
How tough the world is
For the ordinary ones
Who have little love around them
Or too much sun in their glasses

I wanted to be a tough guy
Who doesn’t care about the future
A robot
A gold medalist in spitting
The mugger waiting for you in the dark
The King of Porta Portese
The magpie stealing your wedding ring

“Living life is child's play”
That’s what my mom used to tell me
As I fell from trees
How tough the world is
For the ordinary ones
Who have little love around them
Or too much sun in their glasses

I wanted to be a tough guy
But I’m nobody
A white belt in judo
Instead of a star, just a sneeze

The sunflowers with sunglasses told me
"Beware of the light"
And that moons without craters
Are just rip-offs
And that in the end, there’s no use running away
From your fears

“Living life is child's play”
I - I wanted to be a tough guy
But I'm nobody
I'm nothing but Lucio
I'm nothing but Lucio
