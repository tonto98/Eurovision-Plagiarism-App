We’re the only ones awake in the whole universe
And I still don’t know your desert well
Maybe it’s somewhere in my heart
Where the sun never shines
Where sometimes I lose you
But if I want I get you

We’re a book on the floor in an empty house
Which looks like ours
Coffee with lemon to fight a hangover
You look like a blurry photo
And we screwed up one more night
Outside a club
And thank goodness

If this is the last song 
And then the moon will explode
I’ll be there to tell you you’re wrong
You’re wrong and you know it

The music doesn’t make it here
I know that you don’t sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep ever

How two lives keep turning

We’re the only ones awake in the whole universe
Shouting out a bit of our anger on a rooftop
That no one feels this way
That no one watches movies anymore
The flowers in your room
My metallic top

We’re a book on the floor in an empty house
Which looks like ours

Lost among people
So many words
Without ever an answer
And we screwed up one more night
Outside a club
And thank goodness

If this is the last song 
And then the moon will explode
I’ll be there to tell you you’re wrong 
You’re wrong and you know it

The music doesn’t make it here
And you don’t sleep
And where will you be?
Where are you going?
When life then goes too far
All the running, the fighting, the mistakes you make
When something upsets you

I know that you’re not sleeping
Turn off the light even if you don’t feel like it
We stay in the dark, wrapped up
Only in the sound of the voice
Beyond the madness that dances in all things
Two lives, look what a mess

If this is the last song 
And then the moon will explode 
I’ll be there to tell you you’re wrong 
You’re wrong and you know it
The music doesn’t make it here
I know that you don’t sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep ever

How two lives keep turning
