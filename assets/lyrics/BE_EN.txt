And when the world got me going crazy
I’ll carry on
And it’s all because of you
Because of you

Remember when they told us
You’re not good enough
Then you came into my life
And you changed my world for good
You told me to love myself
A bit harder than yesterday
Cause life is too short
And we sure got to celebrate

And when the world got me going crazy
I’ll carry on
Cause I know I’m strong
And when the world got me going crazy
I’ll carry on
And it’s all because of you
Because of you

Remember when they tried to break us
But look at us now
You told me the right things
At the right time
You got me feeling wild
See now I love myself much more than I did yesterday
Cause life is too short
And we sure got to celebrate
HeeyHey

And when the world got me going crazy
I’ll carry on
Cause I know I’m strong
When the world got me going crazy
I’ll carry on
And it’s all because of

I’ll carry on
Despite of the things
They’ve said and done

They’ll never kill this fire
Your love will take me higher
It’s all because of you
Because of you
Well because of you

Because of you I keep on going
Baby baby
For a brighter da-ay

And when the world got me going crazy
I’ll carry on
See I’ll carry o-on
Because of You
Say I will carry on

And when the world got me going crazy
See I will carry on

And it’s because of you
Because of you
Because of you
