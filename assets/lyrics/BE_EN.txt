All we chase is shining in the moonlight
Are we sure the kids are alright
Or just playing it cool?

Watch it fade
It’s gonna hurt from time to time
One more drink and I’ll be fine
You’re the living proof

Are you still playing the game
Or breaking the rules?
I can see all the pain
In the way that you move

Face to face
They told us it was paradise
But I’ll barely make it through the night
Do you think about it too?

Are you still playing the game
Or breaking the rules?
I can see all the pain
In the way that you move
In the way that you move

I got a soul on fire
I’m gonna make moves tonight
I got a soul on fire
I’m gonna raise roofs tonight

Before the party is over
Before the party is over
Before the party is over
Before the party is over
