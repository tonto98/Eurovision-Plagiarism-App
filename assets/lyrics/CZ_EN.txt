My sister won’t stand in the corner,
Nor will she listen to you.
My sister, wild at heart,
Will never let you tie her down.
My sister won’t stand in the corner,
Nor will she listen to you.

My sister’s crown
Don’t take it down
Don’t take it down
Nobody has right to do it.
She’s beautiful
And capable
She is her own Queen
And she will prove it.

You can take your hands back!
No one wants more boys dead.
We’re not your dolls
We’re not your dolls!

Life’s not a moneybag,
Blood’s on your God’s head
You can’t steal our souls
You can’t steal our souls


My beautiful sister,
You are so strong,
Brave and the only one.
The crown is yours.

Give me your hand,
Don’t be afraid.
Come swim with your sisters,
There’s no place for hate in our sea.

Don’t be sad.
Hop trop
These girls ain’t here for you nonstop.
Remember we’re sisters till the end!

You can take your hands back!
No one wants more boys dead.
We’re not your dolls
We’re not your dolls!

Life’s not a moneybag,
Blood’s on your God’s head
You can’t steal our souls
You can’t steal our souls.

My beautiful sister,
You are so strong,
Brave and the only one.
The crown is yours.

All the sisters of the world,
Come together with a prayer:
CHOOSE LOVE OVER POWER.

My beautiful sister,
You are so strong
Brave and the only one.
The crown is yours.

My beautiful sister,
You are so strong,
Brave and the only one.
The crown is yours.

My beautiful sister,
You are so strong,
Brave and united.

In our hearts, we are with you.

We stand for you.
