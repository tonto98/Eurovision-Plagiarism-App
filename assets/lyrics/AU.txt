I stand in the eye of the spiral
One of them billion-iIlions, billion-iIlions
My soul slips away from its title
One of them billion-iIlions
And I descend to the centre of the earth

I may be dreaming,
But the atoms are awake,
Spill the tea on reality,
And the 0.618

What ya gonna do in the real world Mickey?
What ya gonna do when you see?
Milkali, milkali kutju, Milkali

Escape with us to the planets
To the Fleetwood Macs and the Janets
Milkali la

While entertaining the Gods
One Milkali la, Milkali la
It’s raining love
One Milkali la, Milkali la

We’re on a gravitron
As it tangles
With them billion-iIlions
Of our souls and angels
We kiss and matter dismantles

To see we don’t own the universe
Feel the borders blur
We belong to her

I may be dreaming,
But the atoms are awake,
Spill the tea on reality,
And the 0.618

What ya gonna do in the real world Mickey?
What ya gonna do when you see?
Milkali, milkali kutju, Milkali

Escape with us to the planets
To the Fleetwood Macs and the Janets
Milkali la

While entertaining the Gods
One Milkali la, Milkali la
It’s raining love
One Milkali la, Milkali la

While entertaining the Gods
One Milkali la, Milkali la
It’s raining love
One Milkali la, Milkali la

Milkali, milkali kutju
Milkali, milkali kutju
Milkali la One Milkali la
It’s raining love
Milkali la, one Milkali la, Milkali la
One Milkali la
