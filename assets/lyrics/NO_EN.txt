She, queen of the kings, running so fast, beating the wind.
Nothing in this world can stop the spread of her wings
She, queen of the kings, broken her cage, threw out the keys.
She will be the warrior of north and southern seas

Got raven hair, it's dark as night
Icy eyes, out of site, out of site
Her heart in spite, is warm and bright
Her smile awakes the northern light

Looking out, she calls! laidadadilaida!
Who will conquer all?

Her name is
She, queen of the kings, running so fast, beating the wind.
Nothing in this world can stop the spread of her wings
She, queen of the kings, broken her cage, threw out the keys.
She will be the warrior of north and southern seas

A firestone, forged in flames
Wildest card, run the game, run the game
Can't stay the same, in this world of change
Don't fear the pain, just break the chain!

Looking out, she calls! laidadadilaida!
Who will conquer all?

Her name is
She, queen of the kings, running so fast, beating the wind.
Nothing in this world can stop the spread of her wings
She, queen of the kings, broken her cage, threw out the keys.
She will be the warrior of north and southern seas

Dam da da di dam da dam da di dam dam...

Her name is
She, queen of the kings, running so fast, beating the wind.
Nothing in this world can stop the spread of her wings
She, queen of the kings, broken her cage, threw out the keys.
She will be the warrior of north and southern seas
