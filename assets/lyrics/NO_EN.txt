I was a very fine and beautiful maiden
With an evil stepmother. My mother had died.

She transformed me into a sword and a needle
And sent me off to the King’s estate.

The wrath of my stepmother grew
When all the fine people loved me most.

She gave me the hide of a grey wolf
And forced me to go into the woods alone.

And I would never be whole and good
Before I had drunk of my brother’s blood.
