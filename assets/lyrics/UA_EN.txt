Spri-spri-spring carves its way,
No matter what, the world is on her shoulders
Pa-pa-path is winding and rocky
But you should know: your own happiness is in your hands

Come on, little girl, light up
I’m not holy, I’m alive

Mother Teresa and Diva Maria are with us
Barefoot, as if on a blade, they walked on the ground
With us mama Teresa, Diva Maria
All the Divas were born as human beings

Mother Teresa and Diva Maria are with us
Barefoot, as if on a blade, they walked on the ground
With us mama Teresa, Diva Maria
All the Divas were born as human beings

Even when we were little, we searched for a path,
And life is a loop, as if for those who are falling
On her shoulders, still a young girl,
She carries a burden of pain, seeing it as a flaw

Again not as she should be, or too tender,
Clothes on her bones, naked or going down the aisle
Where is your child? What is your life?
But the years are flying! You should be aware: the end is near

And may someone want us to break
May there be energy in you not the elbow-deep, but the finger-deep
And may someone hide hatred and envy behind a smile,
When you let anger into your heart, instead of kindness and love.

But there are saints in the sky, their feet have seen this earth, you know,
That’s why your thorny path is not in vain
And though it may be very scary and dark and sometimes not easy,
But you'll always have your ancestors following you from heaven

Mother Teresa and Diva Maria are with us
Barefoot, as if on a blade, they walked on the ground
With us mama Teresa, Diva Maria
All the Divas were born as a human beings

Mother Teresa and Diva Maria are with us
Barefoot, as if on a blade, they walked on the ground
With us mama Teresa, Diva Maria
All the Divas were born as human beings
