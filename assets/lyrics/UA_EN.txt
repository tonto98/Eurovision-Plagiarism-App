You will… you’ll visit me too
My little birdy
A burdened tune takes flight on your wings

Dearest heart, my beloved
Don’t you worry
Fate entrusted the world to the last of us

I seek the light, I’ll move mountains
And I call you

Fly
Bird
I’m begging you
Begging you please just
Live
Share
My heart with someone who
Cares
Of
Me and my little bird of pray

Return and lead us back home
The familiar path
The song of migrating birds will awaken the spring

I call you

Fly
Bird
I’m begging you
Begging you just
Care
Of
Me and my little bird

Fly
Like a Bird
Where do you go
I’m begging you please just
Live
Share
My heart with someone who
Flies
Bird
I’m begging you
Begging you please just
Live
Share
My heart with someone who
Cares
Of
Me and my little bird of pray
