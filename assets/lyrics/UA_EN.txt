Sometimes gotta let it go
Sometimes gotta look away
Sometimes you just gotta know
When to stick your middle finger up in the air

I cannot explain
Tell you how I feel
Life is just a game
And I’m playing for the win

Don't be scared to say just what you think
Cause’ no matter how bad, someone’s listening

Don't care what you say
Don't care how you feel
Get out of my way
Cos I got a heart of steel

Don’t care what you say…
Or how you feel….
Oh I got a heart of steel
Oooh

You just like to act a fool
Trynna get in my head like
When I turn on my headlights
I can see right through you

Trynna get a reaction
I just hit the action move

Незважаючи на біль [despite the pain]
Я продовжую свій бій [I continue my fight]
Світ палає, а ти дій [the world is on fire, and you act]

Don't be scared to say just what you think
Cause’ no matter how bad, someone’s listening

Don't care what you say
Don't care how you feel
Get out of my way
Cos I got a heart of steel

Don’t care what you say…
Or how you feel….
Oh I got a heart of steel
Oooh

Don’t care what you say…
Or how you feel….
Oh I got a heart of steel
Oooh
