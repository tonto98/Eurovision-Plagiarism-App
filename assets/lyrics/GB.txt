Someone lost a shoe,
I'm still in last night's makeup,
I'm waking up like, what's this new tattoo?
Room is spinning,
Ears are ringing,
Clutch my pearls like...

What the hell just happened?
What the hell just happened?
No clue but I liked it.

1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4!

Broke a heel,
Lost my keys,
Scraped my knee,
When I fell from the chandelier.
Oh what a night,
I don't mind,
It was time to unwind and I volunteered.

Look at me now,
I'm like usually keep it clean,
Beauty sleep,
Sip my tea.

What the hell just happened?
What the hell just happened?
Went up on the roof,
Jumped into the pool,
You should do it too too too too,
What the hell just happened?
No clue but I liked it.

Ripped my dress,
Called my ex,
I confess,
I'm obsessed,
Not the best idea.
Oh I'm a mess,
It's a trend,
In my defence it's been a real hard year.

Freedom!
I wanna shave my head oh,
Freedom,
Paint the whole town red oh,
Freedom,
I wanna kiss a stranger,
What the hell just happened? Ooooh
What the hell just happened?

What the hell just happened?
What the hell just happened?
Went up on the roof,
Jumped into the pool,
You should do it too too too too.
I know that I'm a wreck,
What did you expect?
You can blame my ex ex ex.
What the hell just happened?
No clue but I liked it.
