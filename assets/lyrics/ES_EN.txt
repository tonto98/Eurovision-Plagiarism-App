Since I was very little
Before learning how to walk
I was the world’s only “rumbera”
For me it was so usual

And I found out a theatre supreme
Disdaining the others in the dressing room
But the so-called diva
Due to the echo of a lifetime
That didn't belong to her
Became bewitched

A diva is simple
Like a mere mortal
A diva doesn’t step
On anyone else to shine
Her voice makes her great
Who cares?
Because she is free singing
Like a fish in water

A diva is so brave
So powerful
Her life’s like a garden full of thorns and roses
She rises while dancing
Stronger than a hurricane

She’s the early morning mother
An artist with no line-up
With or without a fortune
They are divas as well

Fame is not your greatness
Equality is my flag
And music is my only enthusiasm

A diva is simple
Like a mere mortal
A diva doesn’t step
On anyone else to shine
Her voice makes her great
Who cares?
Because she is free singing
Like a fish in water

A diva is so brave
So powerful
Her life’s like a garden full of thorns and roses
She rises while dancing
Stronger than a hurricane

You'll see…

Diva, diva, diva, diva
Diva, diva, diva, diva
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Diva, diva, diva, diva
Diva, diva, diva, diva
Oh, oh, oh, oh
We’re divas
You and I
Because she is free singing
Like a fish in water

A diva is so brave
So powerful
Her life’s like a garden full of thorns and roses
She rises while dancing
Stronger than a hurricane

You'll see…
That divа iѕ ME
