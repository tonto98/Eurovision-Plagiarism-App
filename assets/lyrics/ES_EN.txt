Ya ea
Ya ea
(Ole!)

Oh, come to me, child of mine 
Oh, come to me, child of mine
Sleep by my side
Because in my chest there’s a shelter
A little shelter for your grief

Ya ea ea, Ya ea ea
Ya ea ea, Ya ea ea
Ya ea ea, Ya ea ea

Little tears from the Nile, sleepless nights

My child, when I die
May they bury me in the moon
So that I’ll see you every night
So that I’ll see you every night
So that I’ll see you every night
Every night but one
(Ole!)


Oh, come to me, child of mine (oh child of mine, kid of mine)
Kid of my loves
Whose eyes like a Sun
Illuminate me at night

Ya ea ea, Ya ea ea
Ya ea ea, Ya ea ea
Ya ea ea, Ya ea ea

Little tears from the Nile, sleepless nights

My child, when I die
May they bury me in the moon
So that I’ll see you every night
So that I’ll see you every night
So that I’ll see you every night

My child, when I die
May they bury me in the moon
So that I’ll see you every night
Every night but one

Ya ea ea, Ya ea ea
Ya ea ea, Ya ea ea
Ya ea ea, Ya ea ea

Little tears from the Nile, sleepless nights

Ya ea ea, Ya ea ea
Ya ea ea, Ya ea ea
Ya ea ea, Ya ea ea
