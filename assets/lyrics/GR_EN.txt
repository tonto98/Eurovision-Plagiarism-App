Late August
Feet start to shake heart starts to ache
Can’t focus
Panic I lay on the floor and I hate
That I’m holding on
My lungs’ll break can’t stop to make
My mind up
Time starts to rain clouds not afraid

Of the pain they’re giving
Anxious the way I’m breathing
Can’t say that I am longing for
Another day to break my spirit
Insane and I can tell who’s winning
Wish this was something I could just ignore

Well you know what they say
Lost souls make sure no one loses their way
Hurt ones can’t stand seeing others in pain
Oh I am both now I got too much on my plate
And I save all the others cause for me it’s too

Nostalgic mind,
I miss the days when my heart wouldn’t ache and
I’m drowning, time
Quicksand of life, we don’t live to die
Now I’m tryna, fight
All of the lights that leave me so blind
As a writer
But I’m not an actor no I don’t live my own

Life and I hate my feelings,
I’m overwhelmed and heated,
Can’t say that I am longing for,
Another day to break my spirit,
Insane and I can tell who’s winning,
Wish this was something I could just ignore,

Well you know what they say
Lost souls make sure no one loses their way
Hurt ones can’t stand seeing others in pain
Oh I am both now I got too much on my plate
And I save all the others cause for me it’s too

(Oh Yeahh)

Well you know what they say
Lost souls make sure no one loses their way
Hurt ones can’t stand seeing others in pain
Oh I am both now I got too much on my plate
And I save all the others cause for me it’s too late
