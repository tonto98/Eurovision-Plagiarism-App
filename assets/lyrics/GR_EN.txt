My star,
My star,

My sweet mother, do not weep,
Though they dress you in mourning black.
This faded, weary body of mine,
No flame can ever crack.

The swallows born of fire’s embrace,
No matter how far they roam,
Shall never forget the sacred earth
That once they called their home.

Oh, my little starry-eyed one,
Lean, let me kiss you.
Upon your holy tears of light,
Let my parched lips rest anew.

Oh, my little starry-eyed one,
Lean, let me hold you.
Let these weary, forgotten wings
Find their last breath upon you.

Ah, my star, my precious light…

My sweet mother, do not weep,
My life’s a vessel, drifting free,
Forever searching for its home,
The wind, its sail at sea.

Oh, my little starry-eyed one,
Lean, let me hold you.
Let these weary, forgotten wings
Find their last breath upon you.

Ah, my star, my precious light…
Ah, my star, my precious light…

My star…
