We’re not junkies, we haven’t done anything
The dresses we have on are dumpster-find
TV show COPS and a police raid in the cottage
The only bag here is full of deposit bottles

We’re not junkies, we haven’t done anything
The dresses we have on are dumpster-find
TV show COPS and a police raid in the cottage
A visit from men in uniform? That’s totally ok

UUUUyEEEE

Listen to this now
We gon’ be done getting turnt
You can hear us tonight
But take this bag away

I don’t know drugs, I know soda and cider
Couldn’t tell the difference between vitamins and speed

UUUU

Listen to this now
We gon’ be done getting turnt
You can hear us tonight
But take this bag away

Russulas and champignons, where are your threads?
You turn on my body like a kitchen stove

Ducklings are so small, but poppies are so tall
We avoid intoxicating substances, that’s something rich people do
Present early in the morning, and crowing like roosters,
My candies were taken away by some sad-faced girls

Intoxicating substances we avoid cause we’re not rich
in the backroom of the hut, there are only IPAs on the table
And the sunglasses are for eye pupils, well, actually for the laughs obviously
You can see right through them if you’ve made it to the front row

Shut up, I haven’t done anything
I have only been surrounded by this dance
Yea
Shut up, I haven’t seen anything
I have only been surrounded by this dance
Yea

UUUU

Listen to this now
We gon’ be done getting turnt
You can hear us tonight
But take this bag away

I don’t know drugs, I know soda and cider
Couldn’t tell the difference between vitamins and speed

UUUU

Listen to this now
We gon’ be done getting turnt
You can hear us tonight
But take this bag away

Russulas and champignons, where are your threads?
You turn on my body like a kitchen stove
