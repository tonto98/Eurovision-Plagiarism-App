Now I’m heading home
To solid ground
Realised that all the lies I’ve told myself have died
Bring me to the place
Where I belong
Filled with all the memories and dreams I have ignored

Aaaaa Aaaa Aaaaa

There is always time
To get back on track
Tearing down the walls
Slowly every step
Now I see myself
Building up a world of bridges

There is one more thing
You need to know
That I forgive myself for all the lies I said before
Now I see the road
Of leading lights
Showing me where I should go and what to leave behind

Aaaa Aaaa

There is always time
To get back on track
Tearing down the walls
Slowly every step
Now I see myself
Building up a world of bridges
You will find a way
To begin again
No more time to waste
Or to play pretend
Now I see myself
Building up a world of bridges

I remember all the things that I went through
All the lies and blurry lines and city lights I knew
Now I'm strong enough to see what lays inside
And I can feel it all

There is always time
To get back on track
Tearing down the walls
Slowly every step
Now I see myself
Building up a world of bridges
You will find a way
To begin again
No more time to waste
Or to play pretend
Now I see myself
Building up a world of bridges
