Empty words only fuel the fire
The houses are burning, they start to collapse
From her eyes, the greatest downpour
The foundations of everything have already begun to rot

Just to protect her

Your eyes see pain
For my eyes, it only gives a feeling

Don’t be afraid, I cry in your dreams
Only in your dreams, I cry

Yours, yours, yours, yours…
