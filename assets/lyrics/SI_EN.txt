We'll be dancing all night long.
We’ll love each other and play.
As if there was no tomorrow.

Ever fewer words, thin ice burning under our feet, 
But we're running away from the draught.
You must only work for 810,000 years to make your soul breathe a little.

Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
You win if you stay alive.
I'll take everything, you get nothing.
Do you really want it like this?

The game of hatred is your thing, thank you, 
Don't count on us.
On us.

We'll be dancing all night long.
We’ll love each other and play.
As if there was no tomorrow.
We won't count the hours until the dawn arises.
We'll jump across the mountains.
To be embraced by the sky.

The first rain will wash away all the fake glitter, 
So it stops stealing the magic from the dance floors,
The darkness will bring out the shine in our eyes

The game of hatred is your thing, thank you, 
Don't count on us.
We'll be even louder.

We'll be dancing all night long.
We'll love each other and play.
As if there was no tomorrow.
We won't count the hours until the dawn arises.
We'll jump across the mountains.
We'll accept that we are eternal and happy 
Only as long as the sky keeps embracing us.

We danced, loved, and played all night. 
We lived as if there was no tomorrow
