Welcome. My name is Windows... Windows95man
And I only live by one rule, and the rule is... NO RULES!

(No rules...)
Silence, I say
This is my time - my stage
Call me what you may, see if I care
See me slay!

Is there something wrong with the way I look?
Is there something wrong with who I am?

If I’m not alright
Tell me why do I
Feel so beautiful tonight
NO RULES!

It’s how I live
How I find the wind beneath my wings
It’s how I learn to fly
NO RULES!

In the heat of the night
In the thrill of the fight
I don’t even care what’s wrong or right
It’s how I live my life
NO RULES!

Quiet as I speak
I am the king - I am the queen
And you all gonna be free
Forget the rules and scream!

Is there something wrong with the way I look?
Is there something wrong with who I am?

If I’m not alright
Tell me why do I
Feel so beautiful tonight
NO RULES!

It’s how I live
How I find the wind beneath my wings
It’s how I learn to fly
NO RULES!

In the heat of the night
In the thrill of the fight
I don’t even care what’s wrong or right
It’s how I live my life
NO RULES!

It’s how I live
How I find the wind beneath my wings
It’s how I learn to fly
(Make some noise, let’s go!)

In the heat of the night
In the thrill of the fight
I don’t even care what’s wrong or right
It’s how I live my life
NO RULES!

It’s how I live
How I find the wind beneath my wings
It’s how I learn to fly
(Come on!)
NO RULES!

In the heat of the night
In the thrill of the fight
I don’t even care what’s wrong or right
It’s how I live my life
NO RULES!
