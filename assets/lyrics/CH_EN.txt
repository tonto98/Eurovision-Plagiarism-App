My candid eyes discover the world in a naive way
That confounds the demons of the night.
You throw words at me that choke me.
No matter what, I'll lie next to you tonight.

One day you'll understand that flowers are more beautiful when you water them
You've cut me so many times.

If you want I'll go with you on a journey.
Go on a journey, journey.
Go on a journey with you.

Let me love you even if you don't.
I'll drown in your tears.
I'll share your melancholy.
You eat me up with your gaze.
No matter what I'll never stop singing to you.

You'll understand one day that flowers are more beautiful when you water them.
You've cut me so many times.

If you want I'll go with you on a journey.
Go on a journey, journey. Go on a journey with you.

Go on, go on a journey.
Go on, go on a journey.
Go on, go on a journey.
With me.
Go on, go on a journey.
Go on, go on a journey.
Go on, go on a journey.
With me. With me.

If you want I'll go with you on a journey.
Go on a journey, journey.
Go on a journey with you.
