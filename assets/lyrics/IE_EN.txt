We take our first breath and then we exhale,
Then we give it all we got until we fail,
We get back up again we take a look around,
Oh life can be a long road but at least we're not alone.

We might be different, we might be unique,
You might be a leader, I might be a freak,
And we might be different but under the falling sun,
Tonight...

We are one!
We are one!
When we rise, we rise like the sun,
When we go down, we go down,
We go down, we go down.

We take our first step and then we fall,
But still we keep on, going climbing every wall,
We keep on fighting, turning every stone,
And life can be a long road, at least we're not alone.

We might be different, we might be unique,
You might be a leader, I might be a freak,
And we might be different but under the falling sun.
Tonight...

We are one!
We are one!
When we rise, we rise like the sun,
When we go down, we go down,
We go down, we are one.

We might be different, we might be unique (we are one),
You might be a leader I might be a freak (we are one),
And we might be different but under the falling sun,
Tonight...
We are one!

We might be different, we might be unique (we are one),
You might be a leader, I might be a freak,
When we rise, we rise like a sun,
When we go down, we go down, we go down, we go...
We are one!
