If all you see in me is a perfect doll
Who smiles and then shuts up when you want her to
Forget me, I'm not your puppet
That's the way it is, that's the way it is
Your little game is over

If you think a man like you can manipulate me
Go back to mummy, you’d better give up
Or else, I'm the one who will dismantle you
Beware, beware,
Because I'm taking the controls

New instruction manual
I can do everything without you
It's another setup
Another era
I make my voice heard
So, above all, don't play
The ventriloquist

The doll turns up the sound
Na na na na na na
Remember the lesson
Na na na na na na
The doll turns up the sound
Na na na na na na
Watch out, boy
Na na na na na na
The doll turns up the…

If you thought I was fragile like porcelain
Or more malleable, like polyethylene
I'm not like that, I need oxygen
Don't blame me, don't blame me,
A new world is calling me
If you were intending to display me in your showcase
With your complete collection of figurines,
Sorry for you but I alone determine
Where my heart goes, my heart goes
Yes, I am pulling the strings

New instruction manual
I'm relying on myself alone now
You see, that's the sign
Of another era
I make my voice heard
To trigger in you
The electroshock

The doll turns up the sound
Na na na na na na
Remember the lesson
Na na na na na na
The doll turns up the sound
Na na na na na na
Watch out, boy
Na na na na na na
The doll turns up the sound

Your doll, as you call her,
Turns up the decibels
She is the echo of a new generation
Without rags or plastic
In her specifications,
Your doll conducts the music
She turns up the…
She turns up the…
She turns up the sound

The doll turns up the sound
Na na na na na na
Remember the lesson
Na na na na na na
The doll turns up the sound
Na na na na na na
Watch out, boy
Na na na na na na
The doll turns up the sound
Na na na na na na
Remember the lesson
Na na na na na na
The doll turns up the sound
