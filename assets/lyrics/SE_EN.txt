She comes alive at night
When her prey’s asleep
Make your eyes go blind
And now you’re in too deep

She’s gonna chew you up
And leave you empty, hollow
Then she’ll spit you out
Anyway I follow

She’s gonna hurt you bad
But it feels so good
I don’t care
No I don’t care

You better know she’s dangerous
She is unforgettable
And it feels so good it hurts
She is unforgettable

Whoah
She’s unforgettable
She’s unforgettable

She’s unforgettable

Her love is venomous
It’s getting serious

She’s gonna chew you up
And leave you empty, hollow
Then she’ll spit you out
Anyway I follow

She’s gonna hurt you bad
But it feels so good
I don’t care
No I don’t care

You better know she’s dangerous
She is unforgettable
And it feels so good it hurts
She is unforgettable

Whoah

She’s unforgettable
She’s unforgettable

She’s unforgettable

Her love
Is dangerous
And I know it
It’s venomous
Cause I feel it
Inside of me
She’s unforgettable

Her love
Is dangerous
And I know it
It’s venomous
Cause I feel it
Inside of me

She’s unforgettable
