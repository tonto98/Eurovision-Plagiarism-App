Oh well!

The clock is ticking, now it’s time
All worries will soon be gone
Best remedy for body and soul
Four walls in wooden panels

Oh eh-oh eh-oh
Our wood warms just as well
Oh eh-oh eh-oh
Like tango with Arja Saijonmaa

One two three
Sauna

We’re gonna sauna, sauna
Steam it up and let go of all stress today
Sauna brothers, we’re the ones who glow
100 degrees, oh yes
Just sauna, sauna
Steam it up, till the sweat just sprays
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Sauna, yeah

We’re gonna sauna, sauna
Steam it up and let go of all stress today
Sauna brothers, we’re the ones who glow
100 degrees, oh yes
Just sauna, sauna
Throw it on, till the sweat just sprays
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Sauna, yeah

Sauna! Sauna!
Yeah, that’s right

Pour some water, let’s get more steam
Tick tick tock, how long can you last?
90 degrees, we’re almost there
Damn it, turn up the heat!

Oh eh-oh eh-oh
Sweat is dripping, yeah yeah
Oh eh-oh eh-oh
