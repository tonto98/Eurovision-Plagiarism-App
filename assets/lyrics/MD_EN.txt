Dense leaf forest,
I think I've found my bride,
Like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this
River Nistru with pristine water,
I got lost, and it's only her fault
Like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this
I sang her so many songs
Until she wanted to kiss me
Like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this
I sang to her, I danced with her,
I pampered her in all sorts of ways,
Like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this

The Sun, the Sun, the Sun and the Moon
Will hold, will hold, will hold our wedding crown
The Sun, the Sun, the Sun and the Moon
Will hold, will hold, will hold our wedding crown

The Sun, the Sun, the Sun and the Moon
Will hold, will hold, will hold our wedding crown
The Sun, the Sun, the Sun and the Moon
Will hold, will hold, will hold our wedding crown

I promised my bride
A wedding under a starry sky
Like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this
I gave her on the 7th evening
I gave her on the 7th evening
A ring with a precious stone
Like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this

The Sun and the Moon
The Sun and the Moon
Will hold our wedding crown
Will hold our wedding crown
The Sun, the Sun, the Sun and the Moon
Will hold, will hold, will hold our wedding crown
The Sun, the Sun, the Sun and the Moon
Will hold, will hold, will hold our wedding crown
The Sun, the Sun, the Sun and the Moon
Will hold, will hold, will hold our wedding crown
